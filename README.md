# MTG DRAFT

This is a small project application. Currently only M21, THB, and ZNR are available to draft. Eventually I'd like to support all sets on standard rotation.

To run this project locally, run the following command from the main directory:

### `npm start`

You may need to install various dependencies, everything you need will be available with npm.
Additionally you can view the live project here: http://draftbucket.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com

Feedback, suggestions, and bug reports are always welcome, you can reach me at dpayne5@berkeley.edu
