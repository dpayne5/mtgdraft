# MTG DRAFT

This is a small project application. Currently only M21, THB, and ZNR are available to draft. Eventually I'd like to support all sets on standard rotation.

To run this project locally, run the following command from your directory:

### `npm start`

Feedback, suggestions, and bug reports are always welcome, you can reach me at dpayne5@berkeley.edu
