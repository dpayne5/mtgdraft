# MTG DRAFT

This is a small project application. Eventually I would like to support drafting against
an AI that plays a basic strategy for sets in standard rotation.

To run this project locally, run the following command from the directory:

### `npm start`

Feedback/suggestions are always welcome, you can reach me at dpayne5@berkeley.edu
